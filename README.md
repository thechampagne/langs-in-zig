# Languages Written in Zig

This is a list of languages implemented in
Zig. It is intended as a source of inspiration and comparison, and as a
directory of potentially interesting projects in this vein. Inspired by [langs-in-rust](https://github.com/alilleybrinker/langs-in-rust).

## What Can Be Included?

1. Is it a language?
2. Is it written in Zig?

Then it can be included in this list!
